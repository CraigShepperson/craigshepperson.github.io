Every organisation is unique, there is no one size fits all approach. To know whether the principles and practices you are using, are having the desired impact, you need to know what your desired outcomes are and keep your eye on that ball.

Speed, impact and health are the goals, not Agile, Lean or DevOps as the goal. Then identify the biggest impediment. When it is no longer the weakest link in the chain stop strengthening it. Identify what might be the next biggest impediment; alleviate it. Repeat, forever.

It’s good to ask yourself a few questions to prepare for the conversation ahead.

- **Why is this important?** What’s motivating the company to spend time on this topic? How does it beat out other goals? How high up does the plan go?
- **Why is this important now?** Software organisations can always be more effective, but now is suddenly the time you’re paying attention. What changed?
- **What have you tried so far?** How did you decide you needed to do something else?
- **What metrics are you tracking today?** Where are they falling short? How are they changing over time?
- **What does “better” look like?** It’s two years later, and everything is better. What has changed?
