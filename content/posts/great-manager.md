Your job first and foremost is to execute. As a manager, you are a leader who harnesses your team's skills to achieve specific goals. To accomplish this, you need to be an adept coach, communicator, and decision-maker. Navigating a continuous journey of self-improvement, learning, and adaptation. Balancing technical expertise with strong interpersonal skills and a strategic mindset will help you excel in this role.

It's also about recognising that the success of the team is intricately tied to the well-being and professional growth of individual team members. 

While senior engineers act as force multipliers through technology, you serve as a multiplier through people.
