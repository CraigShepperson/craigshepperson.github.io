Congratulations on your new role as an engineering manager!

<!--more-->

Your job first and foremost is to execute. As a manager, you are a leader who harnesses your team's skills to achieve specific goals. To accomplish this, you need to be an adept coach, communicator, and decision-maker.

While staff engineers act as force multipliers through technology, you serve as a multiplier through people.

This is a collection of heuristics I've learned from my own experience and from other managers.
